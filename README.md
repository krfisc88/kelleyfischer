# portfolio

## Kelley Fischer

This is my portfolio. It represents me on the internet, so it needs to be great. It's still a work in progress, but this is the best one yet.

## Layout

### Home Page

This is where I do a little show-boating and inject a little humour into my site. It's supposed to represent my perosnality, which I believe it does so nicely with the organic company theme. Going for a 'playful, yet elegant' feel.

### Projects Page

Here is where projects I've worked on will be displayed as images with links. I don't know what to really include yet, but hopefully I'll finish the sites for Triple Arrow and Green Bandana so I can include them.

### Process Page

This is for explaining my design process. I really need to start using a design process.

### Skills

I'll put badges for the frameworks/languages/etc. that I know how to use, not sure how to display them yet. Maybe a collage? Or an animation like a trophy case or something...
